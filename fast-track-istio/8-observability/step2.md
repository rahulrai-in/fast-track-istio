In a distributed system, a request may travel through multiple microservices before returning a response to the user. Therefore, it is critical for microservices to implement distributed tracing with a correlation identifier so that the request flow graph of any request can be traced. Istio implements the [OpenTracing](https://opentracing.io/) standard. Istio also supports integration with popular visualization tools such as [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/), [Grafana](https://grafana.com/), and [Kiali](https://www.kiali.io/), which can help developers and operations visualize the state of the mesh.
