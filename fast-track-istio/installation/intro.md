In this scenario, you will learn how to deploy Istio Service Mesh to Kubernetes. Istio is an open platform that provides a uniform way to connect, manage, and secure microservices. Istio supports managing traffic flows between microservices, enforcing access policies, and aggregating telemetry data, all without requiring changes to the microservice code

The scenario uses the sample BookInfo application. The application has no dependencies on Istio and demonstrates how any application could build upon Istio without modifications.
